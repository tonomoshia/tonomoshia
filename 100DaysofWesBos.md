# 100 Days of Wes Bos

![Wes-Bos](wesbos.png)

This is [Wes Bos][11]. He's a great teacher and programmer. He also has a podcast for Web Developers (with Scott Tolinksi) called [Syntax.fm][9]. He's on twitter [@wesbos][12].

I have bought a few of his courses but never finished them so I am starting, today, March 31, 2020, a concerted effort to finish what I started (and bought!) with **#100DaysOfWesBos** a cheeky offshoot of [**#100DaysOfCode**][13] which I have done twice. (I started #365DaysOfCode once, but it was too much of a commitment.)

### A side note

As of today, March 31, 2020,  [Wes Bos][11] is having a 50% off sale on all of his courses, so if you are stuck at home with some time on your hands during the [Covid-19 Quarantine days][10], now is a good time to upskill and learn some code at a discounted price. He lists the sale on the banner on top of all the course pages (unless they are free--free is still free!)

# 100 Days of Wes Bos

### Day 1 - 03.31.2020
Started and finished [**Mastering Markdown**][1]. I know and love Markdown but I would like to fill in any gaps before I get started with everything else. Able to finish it during my lunch hour and bang out _**this**_ document. 

### Day 2 - 04.01.2020
Plan: [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Looking forward to _"Getting the Most Out of ZSH with Plugins"_. While I use Oh My Zsh, I didn't know there were plugins for ZSH. This one is about 75 minutes long so one lunch hour won't do it.

Actual: Went through 6/11 of the videos of [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Didn't get to my favorite part yet, but that just means something to look forward to. Discovered [iTerm2 themes][17], [ZSH themes][16] and [Powerline fonts][15]. Git is more fun when it's color-coded and readable. 

### Day 3 - 04.02.2020
Plan: Finish [**Command Line Power User**][8].

Actual: I did finish [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Learned so many tips and tricks that are possible with ZSH. Like ```take``` instead of separate ```mkdir``` and ```cd``` commandds. Like advanced history commands with one word and tab or control r. Really neat. The trick is to use them so I don't forget them. 

[ZSH plugins][18] extend the functionality and features of ZSH. So the ones I tried: 
- node 
- npm 
- common-aliases
- extract 
- git-prompt
- github

The [z][19] is not working so hot for me right now, so I will leave that for now. 

Learned the reasons to use ```trash``` instead of ```rm```. Only possible if you use ZSH instead of bash, I believe. Installable by npm with this command line: ```npm install --global trash-cli```. Literally **awesome**. Find [trash on npm][21]

Then add ```alias rm=trash``` to your .zshrc to reduce typing & safely trash 

Found this list of [awesome ZSH frameworks, plugins, themes and tutorials][20].

Also _forgot to eat my lunch and had to eat at my desk after lunch_. Oops.

### Day 4 - 04.03.2020
**Plan:** Start Flexbox.io. Should be able to get through 4/20 videos. 

### Day 4 - 04.04.2020
Attended [Remote Control Summit][23] Day 1. 

Completed 4/20 videos from [Flexbox.io][7] 

(Couldn't do yesterday as I skipped lunch hour to make up for the time missed for my a.m. doctor appointment. Our boss bought the office at lunch and I ate at my desk and worked through lunch. (Thanks boss!) No free time at home.)

- [Github page about What The Flexbox][22]

### 04.05.2020

Attended [Remote Control Summit][23] Day 2. 

### Day 5 - 04.07.2020

Completed section on alignment (videos 6, 7, 8, and 9). Aligning with ```justify-content```, ```align-items```, ```align-self```, and ```align-content```. More clarity on main axis and cross-axis.

Referred us to this great resource: [CSS Tricks Explainer][24].

And, I found this one: [Article from WPMUDev about Flexbox in WordPress][25] .

### Day 6 - 04.08.2020
Completed videos 10, 11, 12, and 13 about ```flex``` property with  ```flex-grow```, ```flex-shrink```, ```flex-basis``` and wrapping along with cross-browser support and using autoprefixers to fill in gaps in browser support. 

### Day 7 - 04.09.2020
Completed [Flexbox.io][7] videos 14 and 15 about  making navigation menus and handling mobile re-ordering with flexbox. 

### Day 8 - 04.11.2020
Completeted 4 sections of Javascript curriculum that [LaunchCode][27] is planning to use for their next cohort in my area. Did a [Focusmate][26] session for the first time. It's an accountability buddy app and it did keep me planted in my chair for the entire 50 minutes so I guess you could say it worked. I did not wander the internet for other topics either because I told my buddy for the day, James, _I was intending to get through 4 or 5 sections_ and I didn't want to tell him I didn't at the end. So I did get through to section 4.4 during the session and continued after it was done.  

[Exercise completed for section 4.8][28]

[Studio completed for section 4.9][29]

Continuing with [Flexbox.io][7] with videos 16 and 17. Nested Flexbox really blew my mind. I don't remember them mentioninig this in [freecodecamp][32].

### Day 9 - 04.14.2020

Finished [Flexbox.io][7] tonight: 

- Video #18: Equal height columns and leftover elements  
- Video #19: Flexbox single line form (more nested Flexbox!)
- Video #20: Create a mobile app layout with Flexbox (more nested Flexbox --seeing a theme!)

The last video also mentions and shows us [how Flexbox is used in React Active][37]. Pretty cool and I will keep that in my back pocket for later. 

It just works! (Really!) 

Two cool websites Wes Bos has showed us:

 - [lorempixel][33] random image generator for your website in the size you specify. basically a lorem ipsum for photos instead of text. i found a few other [placeholder image][34] sites while i was looking including [lorem picsum][36] (so clever!).
 - [coverr][34] same thing but with video and not random. you pick them. free stock video footage.  try it out. they've even got a great selection of Zoom virtual backgrounds for these trying times.

 _The best thing to come out of this: I am finally understanding what that [monster Flexbox post on CSSTricks][24] is all about._ Show *and* tell.
 
The learning part[Section 5][31] of the Launchcode [Javascript curriculum][30]: Making Decisions with Conditionals which goes from 5.1.1 to 5.5.1. Tonight I completed right before bed.	

### Day 10 - 04.15.2020

**Plan:** 

- Start [CSS Grid][6] at lunch
- The working part (exercies and studio so 5.6 and 5.7) of  [Section 5][31] of the Launchcode [Javascript curriculum][30]: Making Decisions with Conditionals
	- [Exercises in 5.6][38] with conditionals
		- add link to repl.it link for exercieses 1 and 2
		- add link to repl.it for exercises 3 and 4
	- [Studio in 5.7][39] about goal setting and having the right mindset.
- Attend Zoom meetup about the [LaunchCode][27] beta [JavaScript Curriculum][30] after work before my little one gets home from Daddy's house. 

**Actual:**

- Started [CSS Grid][6] at lunch. Videos 1-3. Setting up NPM, browser-sync, making sure I have emmet to make life easier, making sure I'm using FIrefox Developer browser for all the CSS Grid Dev Tools goodies. Then a little bit of CSS Grid Funadamentals. Using the #GriddyUp hastag to find other who have done/are doing this course. And there are a few, even now. (This course was made years ago.)
- Read a [post on twitter][40] about suggested order of learning for front-end developers. I was flummoxed to see he put CSS Grid before Flexbox and kept reading down the thread to see that I wasn't alone. You won't understand CSS Grid if you haven't done Flexbox first. This is borne out in the videos when Wes mentions Flexbox and links what you did in Flexbox to how you do it in CSS Grid. Baby steps. (Good post on the [difference between FlexBox and CSSGrid][43]. One big sad difference pointed out by [Hashim Warren][44]: "The main difference for me is Flexbox works everywhere and Grid doesnâ€™t."
- Also [Emmet is the jam][41]! Here's a nice writeup on [8 Emmet Tips You Might Now Know][42].
- Checked out [CSS Grid Generator][45] built by [Sarah Edo][46]. Better to use after learning so I don't shortchange myself on the knowledge. Awesome tool. Another one, [LayoutIt][47] works a little differently.
- Attended Zoom meetup about the [LaunchCode][27] beta [JavaScript Curriculum][30] after work 

### Day 11 - 04.16.2020

Developer tools in Firefox for CSS Grid are incredible. I never knew the depth of this. Almost magical. 
- [CSS Grid Inspector:Examine grid layouts][48]
- [Jen Simmons' Variations on a Grid][49] is a good place to try out Firefox Dev tools on a grid in the wild.
- Saved for later: [Jen Simmons' Layout Lab][50].

[CSSGRid.io][6] videos today:

- 4. CSS Grid Dev Tools (in [Firefox Developer Edition browser][51])
- 5. CSS Grid Implicit and Explicit Tracks (what they are and how to see them in Dev Tools)
- 6. CSS Grid Auto Flow Explained (CSS Grid's version of Flexbox's flex-direction property, sort of)

### Day 12 - 04.17.2020

[CSSGRid.io][6] videos today:

- 7. Sizing tracks in CSS Grid (fractional units of free space, as in ```grid-template-columns: 200px, 200px, 1fr 1fr;```, are better than percentages when working in CSS Grid so that margins don't mess up the proportions of your grid container)
- 8. CSS Grid Repeat Function as in ```grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);``` would give you four evenly spaced columns.
- 9. Sizing Grid Items (on a grid ```item``` not on a grid ```container```you can have one ```item``` span two columns as in  ```grid-column: span 2;```)

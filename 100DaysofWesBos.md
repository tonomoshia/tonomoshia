# 100 Days of Wes Bos

![Wes-Bos](wesbos.png)

This is [Wes Bos][11]. He's a great teacher and programmer. He also has a podcast for Web Developers (with Scott Tolinksi) called [Syntax.fm][9]. He's on twitter [@wesbos][12].

I have bought a few of his courses but never finished them so I am starting, today, March 31, 2020, a concerted effort to finish what I started (and bought!) with **#100DaysOfWesBos** a cheeky offshoot of [**#100DaysOfCode**][13] which I have done twice. (I started #365DaysOfCode once, but it was too much of a commitment.)

### A side note

As of today, March 31, 2020,  [Wes Bos][11] is having a 50% off sale on all of his courses, so if you are stuck at home with some time on your hands during the [Covid-19 Quarantine days][10], now is a good time to upskill and learn some code at a discounted price. He lists the sale on the banner on top of all the course pages (unless they are free--free is still free!)

# 100 Days of Wes Bos

### Day 1 - 03.31.2020
Started and finished [**Mastering Markdown**][1]. I know and love Markdown but I would like to fill in any gaps before I get started with everything else. Able to finish it during my lunch hour and bang out _**this**_ document. 

### Day 2 - 04.01.2020
Plan: [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Looking forward to _"Getting the Most Out of ZSH with Plugins"_. While I use Oh My Zsh, I didn't know there were plugins for ZSH. This one is about 75 minutes long so one lunch hour won't do it.

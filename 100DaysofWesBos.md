# 100 Days of Wes Bos

![Wes-Bos](wesbos.png)

This is [Wes Bos][11]. He's a great teacher and programmer. He also has a podcast for Web Developers (with Scott Tolinksi) called [Syntax.fm][9]. He's on twitter [@wesbos][12].

I have bought a few of his courses but never finished them so I am starting, today, March 31, 2020, a concerted effort to finish what I started (and bought!) with **#100DaysOfWesBos** a cheeky offshoot of [**#100DaysOfCode**][13] which I have done twice. (I started #365DaysOfCode once, but it was too much of a commitment.)

### A side note

As of today, March 31, 2020,  [Wes Bos][11] is having a 50% off sale on all of his courses, so if you are stuck at home with some time on your hands during the [Covid-19 Quarantine days][10], now is a good time to upskill and learn some code at a discounted price. He lists the sale on the banner on top of all the course pages (unless they are free--free is still free!)

# 100 Days of Wes Bos

### Day 1 - 03.31.2020
Started and finished [**Mastering Markdown**][1]. I know and love Markdown but I would like to fill in any gaps before I get started with everything else. Able to finish it during my lunch hour and bang out _**this**_ document. 

### Day 2 - 04.01.2020
Plan: [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Looking forward to _"Getting the Most Out of ZSH with Plugins"_. While I use Oh My Zsh, I didn't know there were plugins for ZSH. This one is about 75 minutes long so one lunch hour won't do it.

Actual: Went through 6/11 of the videos of [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Didn't get to my favorite part yet, but that just means something to look forward to. Discovered [iTerm2 themes][17], [ZSH themes][16] and [Powerline fonts][15]. Git is more fun when it's color-coded and readable. 

### Day 3 - 04.02.2020
Plan: Finish [**Command Line Power User**][8].

Actual: I did finish [**Command Line Power User**][8]. Learned so many tips and tricks that are possible with ZSH. Like ```take``` instead of separate ```mkdir``` and ```cd``` commandds. Like advanced history commands with one word and tab or control r. Really neat. The trick is to use them so I don't forget them. 

[ZSH plugins][18] extend the functionality and features of ZSH. So the ones I tried: 
- node 
- npm 
- common-aliases
- extract 
- git-prompt
- github

The [z][19] is not working so hot for me right now, so I will leave that for now. 

Learned the reasons to use ```trash``` instead of ```rm```. Only possible if you use ZSH instead of bash, I believe. Installable by npm with this command line: ```npm install --global trash-cli```. Literally **awesome**. Find [trash on npm][21]

Then add ```alias rm=trash``` to your .zshrc to reduce typing & safely trash 

Found this list of [awesome ZSH frameworks, plugins, themes and tutorials][20].

Also _forgot to eat my lunch and had to eat at my desk after lunch_. Oops.

### Day 4 - 04.03.2020
Plan: Start Flexbox.io. Should be able to get through 4/20 videos. 

### Day 4 - 04.04.2020
Attended Remote Control Summit Day 1. 

Completed 4/20 videos from [Flexbox.io][7] 

(Couldn't do yesterday as I skipped lunch hour to make up for the time missed for my a.m. doctor appointment. Our boss bought the office at lunch and I ate at my desk and worked through lunch. (Thanks boss!) No free time at home.)
